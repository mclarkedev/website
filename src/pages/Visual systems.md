# Constructing a visual system for user interfaces

"This redesign needs to future proof us for 5 years and we need it done within the quarter." - CEO

Visual systems can be constructed top-down or bottom-up. The top-down approach constructs the system from the user's point of view. I'd like to turn the volume down on my tv so I need a way to tell it to do so. Therefore, our user interface needs to visually communicate how the volume can be turned down. When the user sees how it can be turned down, they're then able to do so.

So, say we design some volume controls that make the most sense for controlling audio. We deep dive into the meaning of audio and determine a graphic to represent the controls. We add it to our control panel and continue to the next feature.

Over time, our interface becomes frustrating to use. Say, we use a plus and minus sign to communicate volume, arrows for channels, and a wheel for menu selection. Suddenly, each control begins to communicates less and less the more we add. To solve for this, top-down, we improve the ergonomics of the layout and wiggle our controls until they feel right. We examine our typography and grid and note some standard values. However, we keep hearing our interface is too complex to easily use. We then reflect on how we isolated each control from the beginning and backed our way into a visual system we can't understand.

Enter the bottom-up approach. The bottom-up approach constructs the system from the medium's point of view. What is the medium we're communicating through and how should it express our interface? This is a powerful approach for designers to adopt when they aspire to simplify complexity or craft good, humble user interfaces.

On that note, welcome to my guide for constructing a visual systems for user interfaces. This guide was written while I redesigned the Associated Press's product design system in 2024.

## Genesis

The bottom-up approach to designing visual systems should start with a base unit that correlates to final medium.

For print...
For hardware...
For unix os...
For graphical os...

In this guide we'll construct a visual system for multiple software mediums.
