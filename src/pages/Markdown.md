Visual systems can be constructed top-down or bottom-up. The top-down approach constructs the system from the user's point of view. I'd like to turn the volume down on my tv so I need a way to tell it to do so. Therefore, our user interface needs to visually communicate how the volume can be turned down. When the user sees how it can be turned down, they're then able to do so.
